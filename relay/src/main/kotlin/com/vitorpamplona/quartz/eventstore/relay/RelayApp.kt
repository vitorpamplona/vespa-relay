 *   GET  /  -> the NIP-11 doc on Accept: application/nostr+json, else [landingPage]
 *              (e.g. a web UI) — or a plain notice when it is null.
 *   POST /  -> the NIP-86 relay-management RPC, when [admin] is configured.
 *
 * The NIP-11 doc is built from [nip11], [limits] (its `limitation` block) and
 * [supportedNips], then held mutably so NIP-86 change-name/description/icon RPCs
 * update what `GET /` serves at runtime.
 *
 * Returns the started server; call `stop(...)` to shut it down. With [wait] = true
 * (the default) it blocks until the server stops, which is what a `main()` wants;
 * pass false to keep serving in the background and manage the lifecycle yourself.
 *
 * The store is NOT owned here — the caller opens and closes it (the relay and, in
 * a fuller app, the sync side share one store).
